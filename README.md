### 7Ô∏è‚É£ <ins>Finding files</ins>

<br>

#### üìå `find` command
- Search for files and directories in a directory hierarchy based on various criteria, such as name, type, size, permissions, modification time, and more.
- Syntax: `find [path...] [expression]`
  - `path`: The directory (or directories) to search. Default is the current directory (`.`).
  - `expression`: The criteria used to filter files or directories.

<br>

  | Option              | Description                                                           |
  |---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `-name <pattern>`   | Searches for files or directories by name (case-sensitive).           |
  | `-iname <pattern>`  | Searches for files or directories by name (case-insensitive).         |
  | `-type <type>`      | Searches by type: `f` for files, `d` for directories, `l` for symbolic links, etc.|
  | `-size <n>`         | Searches for files of a specific size (e.g., `+10M`, `-1G`, `100k`).  |
  | `-mtime <n>`        | Finds files modified `<n>` days ago (`+` for more than, `-` for less than).|
  | `-perm <mode>`      | Finds files with specific permissions (e.g., `644`).                  |
  | `-user <username>`  | Searches for files owned by a specific user.                          |
  | `-group <groupname>`| Searches for files belonging to a specific group.                     |
  | `-empty`            | Finds empty files or directories.                                     |
  | `-exec <command>`   | Executes a command on each matched file (e.g., delete or copy).       |
  | `-maxdepth <n>`     | Limits the depth of the search to `<n>` levels.                       |
  | `-mindepth <n>`     | Starts searching only after `<n>` levels.                             |
  | `-not` or `!`       | Negates a condition (e.g., `! -name "*.txt"` finds files not ending in `.txt`).|
  | `-or`               | Combines conditions using logical OR.                                 |

  | `-regex <pattern>`  | Matches files or directories using a regular expression.              |

<br>

#### üìå `locate` command
- Quickly find the location of files and directories by searching through a pre-built database rather than scanning the filesystem in real time.
- It's faster than `find` but requires the database to be regularly updated using the `updatedb` command.
- Syntax: `locate [OPTION]... PATTERN`
  - PATTERN: The name or part of the name of the file or directory you‚Äôre searching for
- The `locate` command searches a database, usually `/var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db`, which contains a snapshot of the filesystem's file and directory structure.
- This database is updated periodically (e.g., daily) or manually using the `updatedb` command.
- Since it relies on a pre-built database, `locate` may not find files that were recently created or moved unless the database is updated.

## üìù Operations on file contents

<br>

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ <ins>Sorting the file content</ins>

<br>

#### üìå `sort` command

<br>

  | Command             | Description                                                     |

  | `sort filename`     | sort the content from the file (does not save changes to the original file), case is ignored|
  | `sort -o filename` | **(Overwrite)** sort the content from the file and overwrite the original file|
  | `sort -r filename`  | **(Reverse)** sort the content from the file in reverse order   |
  | `sort -n filename`  | **(Numeric)** sort numerically (useful for sorting numbers)     |
  | `sort -k 2 filename`| **(Key)** sorts the lines based on the second field             |
  | `sort -u filename`  | **(Unique)** suppress duplicate lines in the output            |

<br>

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ <ins>Finding unique</ins>

<br>

#### üìå `uniq` command

<br>

  | Command             | Description                                                     |
  |-----------          |-------------                                                    |
  | `uniq filename`     | displays the unique lines from a <ins> sorted file </ins>       |
  | `uniq -c filename.txt`| **(Count)** prefix each unique line with the number of occurrences|
  | `uniq -d filename.txt`| **(Duplicates)** only show duplicate lines                    |
  | `uniq -u filename.txt`| **(Unique)** only show unique lines that are not repeated     |
  | `uniq -i filename.txt`| **(Ignore Case)** treat lines as equal, regardless of case (Uppercase, lowercase)|
  | `uniq -s 5 filename.txt`| skip the first 5 characters when comparing lines            |
  | `uniq -w 3 filename.txt`| compare only the first N characters of each line            |
  | `uniq sorted_data.txt > unique_data.txt`| redirect the unique output to the new file  |

<br>

> [!Note]
> - The `uniq` command only removes **consecutive duplicate**. Therefore, it is often used in conjunction with the `sort` command to ensure all duplicates are adjacent:
> `sort filename.txt | uniq`

<br>

> [!Note]
> - `|` known as the pipe, is a powerful feature in Unix/Linux command-line environments. It is used to chain commands together, allowing the output of one command to be used as the input for another command. This enables users to create complex command sequences that perform multiple operations in a single line.

<br>

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ <ins>Searching the content</ins>

<br>

#### üìå `grep` command
- The `grep` command in Unix/Linux is used for searching and filtering text based on patterns. It is one of the most powerful and commonly used commands for text processing.
- Basic syntax: `grep [options] 'pattern' [file(s)]`
  - `pattern`: The text or regular expression to search for.
  - `file(s)`: The file or files to search within.

<br>

  | Command             | Description                                                     |
  |-----------          |-------------                                                    |
  | `grep "hello" file1 file2` | find all lines in `file1` `file2` that contain the word `hello`|
  | `grep -i "hello" file1` | **(Ignore Case)** find all lines in `file1` that contain the word `hello`, regardless the case|
  | `grep -v "hello" file1` | **(Invert Match)** displays lines that do not contain the word `hello`|
  | `grep -c "hello" file1` | **(Count Matches)** displays number of lines that contain the word `hello`|
  | `grep -n "hello" file1` | **(Show Line Numbers)** displays matching lines along with their line numbers|
  | `grep -l "hello" file1` | **(List Matching Files)** lists the names of files containing matches (useful when searching multiple files)|
  | `grep -w "hello" file1` | **(Match Whole Words)** matches `hello` as a whole word, but not `hello123` or `ahello`|
  | `grep -r "hello" /path/to/directory` | **(Recursive Search)** searches for `hello` in all files within the specified directory and its subdirectories|

<br>

> [!Note]
> - `-E` flag allows using <ins>**Extended Regular Expressions**</ins> for more complex patterns
> - E.g.: `grep -E "cat|dog" file` (matches any of the specified patterns)

<br>

#### üìå `egrep command`
- `egrep` command can be used instead of `grep`. It supports extended regular expressions (ERE) by default.
- `egrep` is equivalent to `grep -E`
- Syntax: `egrep [options] 'pattern' [file(s)]`

## üõ°Ô∏è Working with permissions

<br>

* File permissions in Linux control who can read, write, or execute files and directories. Permissions are assigned to three categories of users:

  - **Owner:** The user who owns the file.
  - **Group:** The group associated with the file.
  - **Others:** All other users on the system.
 
* How to read permissions?
  1. **File type:** The first character (`-`) indicates the file type
      - `-` : Regular file
      - `d` : Directory
      - `l` : Symbolic link
      - `c` : Character device
      - `b` : Block device
     
    2. **Permissions:** Next 9 characters, divided into groups of three
        - **Owner (`rwx`):** The file owner can read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`).
        - **Group (`r-x`):** Members of the group can read (`r`) and execute (`x`), but not write.
        - **Others (`r--`):** All other users can only read (`r`).

* Breakdown of each permission:
  - `r` (read): Permission to read the file or list directory contents.
  - `w` (write): Permission to modify the file or add/remove files in a directory.
  - `x` (execute): Permission to run the file as a program or enter a directory.

<br>

  | Examples            | Description                                                     |
  |-----------          |-------------                                                    |
  | `ls -l filename`    | can be used to display file permissions                         |

<br>

### üìå `chmod` command
- Used to change file permissions. It allows you to modify who can read, write, or execute a file or directory.
-  1Ô∏è‚É£ **Using Symbolic mode**
  -  Syntax: `chmod [WHO][OPERATOR][PERMISSIONS] FILE`
  - **WHO**:
    - `u`: Owner (user)
    - `g`: Group
    - `o`: Others
    - `a`: All (owner, group, and others)
  - **OPERATOR:**
    - `+`: Add permission
    - `-`: Remove permission
    - `=`: Set exact permission

<br>

  | Examples            | Description                                                     |
  |-----------          |-------------                                                    |
  | `chmod u+x file.txt`| Add execute permission for the owner                            |
  | `chmod o-w file.txt`| Remove write permission for others                              |
  | `chmod a=rw file.txt`| Set read and write permissions for all                         |
  | `chmod --reference=source.txt target.txt` | Copy permissions from another file        |


<br>

- 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Using Numeric (Octal) mode**
  - Permissions are represented by three bits:
    - `r` (read) = 4
    - `w` (write) = 2
    - `x` (execute) = 1
  - The total value for a permission set is the sum of these numbers:

  <br>
  
    | Permission | Value | Meaning            |
    |------------|-------|--------------------|
    | `---`      | 0     | No permissions     |
    | `--x`      | 1     | Execute only       |
    | `-w-`      | 2     | Write only         |
    | `-wx`      | 3     | Write and execute  |
    | `r--`      | 4     | Read only          |
    | `r-x`      | 5     | Read and execute   |
    | `rw-`      | 6     | Read and write     |
    | `rwx`      | 7     | Read, write, and execute |

<br>

  - Structure of octal permissions: Permissions are written as three digits, where each digit corresponds to a specific category:
    - First digit: Owner
    - Second digit: Group
    - Third digit: Others

  <br>
  
  | Examples            | Description                                                     |
  |-----------          |-------------                                                    |
  | `chmod 744 file.txt`| Full permissions for the owner, and read-only for others        |
  | `chmod 666 file.txt`| Read and write permissions for everyone                         |
  | `chmod 751 file.txt`| Owner has full permissions, group has read/execute, others have execute only|
  | `chmod 750 file.txt`| No permissions for others                                       |

  <br>
 
  - **Quick reference table:**

  <br>
  
  | Octal   | Owner | Group | Others |
  |---------|-------|-------|--------|
  | `777`   | rwx   | rwx   | rwx    |
  | `755`   | rwx   | r-x   | r-x    |
  | `644`   | rw-   | r--   | r--    |
  | `700`   | rwx   | ---   | ---    |
  | `600`   | rw-   | ---   | ---    |

<br>

### üìå `chown` command
- Used to change the owner and/or group ownership of a file or directory. It is essential for managing file permissions and access.
- Syntax: `chown [OPTIONS] OWNER[:GROUP] FILE`
  - **OWNER:** The new owner (user) of the file/directory.
  - **GROUP:** The new group of the file/directory. Specifying :GROUP is optional.
  - **FILE:** The file or directory whose ownership is being changed.

 <br>
 
  | Examples            | Description                                                     |

## üë®‚Äçüíª User Management

**User** - Entity that performs tasks and actions. Each user has an ID.

There are three types of users in Linux:

| User            | Description                   | ID                |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1. Root User    | Super admin                   | 0                 |
| 2. System Users | Ceated by OS to run processes | 1 - 999           |
| 3. Local Users  | Human users                   | > 999 upto 60,000 |

> [!NOTE]
> - For System Users (processes), if all IDs from 1 t0 999 are already in use, then IDs from local users are assigned to the processes
> - For Local Users, the upper limit of 60,000 is for Ubuntu. This number is kept for optimal performance and can be changed if required.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Why don't we use root user for everyday tasks?**
>   - We have multiple users working on a system, so giving root access to each user is not a good practice, as it would be very difficult to track user activities.
>   - Insted we create local users. These local users can have the root privileges using `sudo`.
<br>

| Commands                                | Description                                                                             |

### Adding user

**1. `useradd` - low level command for user creation**
 - Creates user, but does not create a home directory and other skeleton. We need to create everything manually.

 - Creates user, along with a home directory and other skeleton.

   | Commands                                | Description                               |
   |-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
   | `sudo adduser user_name`                | Creates a new user `user_name`            |

### Delete user

> - Wildcards match filenames and directory names; they do not search within file content.
