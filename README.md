### 7Ô∏è‚É£ <ins>Finding files</ins>

<br>

#### üìå `find` command
- Search for files and directories in a directory hierarchy based on various criteria, such as name, type, size, permissions, modification time, and more.
- Syntax: `find [path...] [expression]`
  - `path`: The directory (or directories) to search. Default is the current directory (`.`).
  - `expression`: The criteria used to filter files or directories.

<br>

  | Option              | Description                                                           |
  |---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `-name <pattern>`   | Searches for files or directories by name (case-sensitive).           |
  | `-iname <pattern>`  | Searches for files or directories by name (case-insensitive).         |
  | `-type <type>`      | Searches by type: `f` for files, `d` for directories, `l` for symbolic links, etc.|
  | `-size <n>`         | Searches for files of a specific size (e.g., `+10M`, `-1G`, `100k`).  |
  | `-mtime <n>`        | Finds files modified `<n>` days ago (`+` for more than, `-` for less than).|
  | `-perm <mode>`      | Finds files with specific permissions (e.g., `644`).                  |
  | `-user <username>`  | Searches for files owned by a specific user.                          |

<br>

#### üìå `locate` command
- Quickly find the location of files and directories by searching through a pre-built database rather than scanning the filesystem in real time.
- It's faster than `find` but requires the database to be regularly updated using the `updatedb` command.
- Syntax: `locate [OPTION]... PATTERN`
  - PATTERN: The name or part of the name of the file or directory you‚Äôre searching for
- The `locate` command searches a database, usually `/var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db`, which contains a snapshot of the filesystem's file and directory structure.
- This database is updated periodically (e.g., daily) or manually using the `updatedb` command.
- Since it relies on a pre-built database, `locate` may not find files that were recently created or moved unless the database is updated.

<br>

  | Options              | Description                                                             |

## üìù Operations on file contents

<br>

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ <ins>Sorting the file content</ins>

<br>

#### üìå `sort` command

<br>

  | Command             | Description                                                     |
  |-----------          |-------------                                                    |
  | `sort filename`     | sort the content from the file (does not save changes to the original file), case is ignored|
  | `sort -o filename` | **(Overwrite)** sort the content from the file and overwrite the original file|
  | `sort -r filename`  | **(Reverse)** sort the content from the file in reverse order   |
  | `sort -n filename`  | **(Numeric)** sort numerically (useful for sorting numbers)     |
  | `sort -k 2 filename`| **(Key)** sorts the lines based on the second field             |
  | `sort -u filename`  | **(Unique)** suppress duplicate lines in the output            |

<br>

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ <ins>Finding unique</ins>

<br>

#### üìå `uniq` command

<br>

  | Command             | Description                                                     |
  |-----------          |-------------                                                    |
  | `uniq filename`     | displays the unique lines from a <ins> sorted file </ins>       |
  | `uniq -c filename.txt`| **(Count)** prefix each unique line with the number of occurrences|
  | `uniq -d filename.txt`| **(Duplicates)** only show duplicate lines                    |
  | `uniq -u filename.txt`| **(Unique)** only show unique lines that are not repeated     |
  | `uniq -i filename.txt`| **(Ignore Case)** treat lines as equal, regardless of case (Uppercase, lowercase)|
  | `uniq -s 5 filename.txt`| skip the first 5 characters when comparing lines            |
  | `uniq -w 3 filename.txt`| compare only the first N characters of each line            |
  | `uniq sorted_data.txt > unique_data.txt`| redirect the unique output to the new file  |

<br>

> [!Note]
> - The `uniq` command only removes **consecutive duplicate**. Therefore, it is often used in conjunction with the `sort` command to ensure all duplicates are adjacent:
> `sort filename.txt | uniq`

<br>

> [!Note]
> - `|` known as the pipe, is a powerful feature in Unix/Linux command-line environments. It is used to chain commands together, allowing the output of one command to be used as the input for another command. This enables users to create complex command sequences that perform multiple operations in a single line.

<br>

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ <ins>Searching the content</ins>

<br>

#### üìå `grep` command
- The `grep` command in Unix/Linux is used for searching and filtering text based on patterns. It is one of the most powerful and commonly used commands for text processing.
- Basic syntax: `grep [options] 'pattern' [file(s)]`
  - `pattern`: The text or regular expression to search for.
  - `file(s)`: The file or files to search within.

<br>

  | Command             | Description                                                     |

  | `grep "hello" file1 file2` | find all lines in `file1` `file2` that contain the word `hello`|
  | `grep -i "hello" file1` | **(Ignore Case)** find all lines in `file1` that contain the word `hello`, regardless the case|
  | `grep -v "hello" file1` | **(Invert Match)** displays lines that do not contain the word `hello`|
  | `grep -c "hello" file1` | **(Count Matches)** displays number of lines that contain the word `hello`|
  | `grep -n "hello" file1` | **(Show Line Numbers)** displays matching lines along with their line numbers|
  | `grep -l "hello" file1` | **(List Matching Files)** lists the names of files containing matches (useful when searching multiple files)|
  | `grep -w "hello" file1` | **(Match Whole Words)** matches `hello` as a whole word, but not `hello123` or `ahello`|
  | `grep -r "hello" /path/to/directory` | **(Recursive Search)** searches for `hello` in all files within the specified directory and its subdirectories|

<br>

> [!Note]
> - `-E` flag allows using <ins>**Extended Regular Expressions**</ins> for more complex patterns
> - E.g.: `grep -E "cat|dog" file` (matches any of the specified patterns)

<br>

#### üìå `egrep command`
- `egrep` command can be used instead of `grep`. It supports extended regular expressions (ERE) by default.

| `history -c`           | clear current session history                                |
| `history -w`           | write current history to history file (`.bash_history`)      |
| `history -d <line_number>` | delete specific entry from history file by line number   |

<br>

> [!NOTE]  
> - History is stroed in `.bash_history` file of the user's home directory.
> - Don't delete the `.bash_history` file directly unless required (i.e., `rm ~/.bash_history`)

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not directly use API keys and passwords into commands as they are saved in history file and can be accessed.
> 
> Solution 1: `read -s -p "Enter API key: " API_KEY`
> - `read` - read user input
> - `-s` - silent mode (input not shown on screen)
> - `-p` - display prompt message
> - `API_KEY` - variable used to store the user input (temporary variable)
> 
> Solution 2: Give one blank space before writing command (command will not be saved in history)
> This will only work if `$HISTCONTROL` (bash environment variable) has `ignorespace` in it.

### üìå `alias` command
| Examples            | Description                                                     |
|-----------          |-------------                                                    | 
| `alias name="command"`| create shortcuts for commands, valid only for current session |
| `unalias name`      | removes alias `name`                                            |

<br>

> [!NOTE]  
> For permenant changes, add alias to `.bashrc` file.
> - It is a shell script file that runs automatically when we start a new terminal session
> - `source ~/.bashrc` - reload bash file without restarting the current terminal session

<br>

**Example 1 (Temporary alias):**

- ```
  alias gac="git add . && git commit -m"
- **Usage:** `gac "Commit message"`

**Example 2 (Permanent alias):**
- Open `.bashrc` file
- Add the piece of code at the end of file
- ```
  gac(){
    git add . && git commit -m "$*"
  }
- Reload file, `source ~/.bashrc`
- **Usage:** `gac "Commit message"`

## üßÆ Shell environment and Environment variables

### Shell environment
The **shell environment** is the collection of settings, environment variables, functions, and configurations that the shell loads and uses when it starts.

**Components of shell environment**
| Component                 | Description                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Environment Variables** | Variables like `PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `JAVA_HOME` |
| **Aliases**               | Shortcuts for commands (e.g., `alias ll='ls -l'`)  |
| **Functions**             | Custom mini-scripts                                |
| **Prompt settings**       | How your terminal looks (`PS1`)                    |
| **Shell options**         | Settings like `set -o noclobber`                   |
| **Startup files**         | Like `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, etc.              |

<br>

**Where is the shell environment defined?**
| File               | Purpose                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.bashrc`        | User-specific settings for interactive shells |
| `~/.profile`       | Run at login (also loads `.bashrc`)           |
| `/etc/profile`     | System-wide login shell config                |
| `/etc/bash.bashrc` | System-wide interactive shell config          |

<br>

**How to view your current shell environment?**
```
env         # List all environment variables
printenv    # Similar to env
set         # Lists all shell variables (environment + functions)
```
<br>

### Environment variable
An environment variable is a key-value pair stored in your shell‚Äôs environment that can affect how processes and programs run.

Example:
```
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64
EDITOR=nano
```

Each of these variables holds some value that the system or applications refer to.

<br>

**Common use cases**
| Variable    | Purpose                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PATH`      | Tells the shell where to look for executable programs (like in `/bin`, `/usr/bin`, etc.) |
| `JAVA_HOME` | Points to the Java installation directory                                                |
| `HOME`      | The current user‚Äôs home directory                                                        |
| `SHELL`     | Default shell (e.g., `/bin/bash`)                                                        |
| `USER`      | Username                                                                                 |
| `PWD`       | Present working directory                                                                |
| `EDITOR`    | Default text editor                                                                      |


<br>

**Steps to set an environment variable**

1Ô∏è‚É£ List all existing environment variables
  - `printenv`

2Ô∏è‚É£ Check a specific variable
  - `echo $VARIABLE_NAME`

3Ô∏è‚É£ Setting a temporary environment variable (for the current shell session)
  - `export VARIABLE_NAME=value`

4Ô∏è‚É£ Setting a permanent environment variable (for the future session)
  - Open your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile` (shell configuration file)
  - Add `export VARIABLE_NAME=value`
  - Save this file
  - Reload configuration file using `source ~/.bashrc`

5Ô∏è‚É£ Unsetting a temporary environment variable
  - `unset VARIABLE_NAME`

6Ô∏è‚É£ Unsetting a permanent environment variable
  - Open `./bashrc` file, locate the line that exports the variable you want to unset
  - Delete or comment out the line and save the file
  - Reload configuration file using `source ~/.bashrc`

## üóÇÔ∏è Linux file system

<br>

The Linux File System is how data is stored, accessed, and managed on a Linux system. `ext4` (fourth extended file system) is the most commonly used file system in Linux.
- We install Linux onto a partition which is formatted as `ext4`
- Then the partition is mounted at `/` ‚Äî making it the **root filesystem**
- Linux follows a tree-like hierarchical structure, starting from a root directory `/`, and branching into various subdirectories.

<br>

**"In Linux, everything is a file."**
- Every resource‚Äîfiles, directories, devices, sockets, pipes, and even processes‚Äîis treated as a file or file-like object.
- This simplifies how the system interacts with various components ‚Äî by using a **common interface**: file descriptors and read/write operations.

<br>

### What is "Root directory (`/`)"?
- Top-most level of the Linux file system hierarchy
- Starting point or base of the file system tree, from which all other directories and files branch out.
- All directories and files are organized under it, no matter which physical disk they‚Äôre on.

<br>

### Important sub-directories under root directory

The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is followed by sub-directories, which is used by most modern Linux distributions.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aacfbcea-1b28-41b8-a46f-d64ea3427b85)

- **`/bin`**
  - `/bin` stands for ‚Äúbinary‚Äù
  - It is a directory that contains user-essential binary executables (compiled programs) for core commands, needed for basic system operation ‚Äî even in single-user mode or during system recovery.
  - These can be used by all users
  - Commands/ Tools: `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `cat`, `bash`, etc.
    
- **`/sbin`**
  - `/sbin` stands for "system binaries"
  - It contains binary executables (compiled programs) that are used for system maintenance, repair, booting, and administration.
  - They are mostly used by `root` users
  - Commands/ Tools: `mount`, `fsck`, `reboot`, `shutdown`, `ifconfig`, `ip`, `init`, `modprobe`, `fdisk`, `mkfs`
 
- **`/boot`**
  - `/boot` is a directory that contains all the files needed to boot your Linux system, before the actual operating system (kernel + userland) is running.
  - It's separate from the rest of the Linux system because:
    - It needs to be accessible very early during boot
    - The system doesn‚Äôt yet load file systems like `/home` or `/usr` at that point
    - It may use simpler filesystems (like ext4) for compatibility
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid editing files here ‚Äî a mistake can make your system unbootable.
    
- **`/dev`**
  - `/dev` contains special files called ‚Äúdevice files‚Äù that represent hardware devices and virtual devices on your system.
  - These are not regular files or binaries ‚Äî they are interfaces to hardware managed by the kernel.
  - Most files are dynamically created and managed by:
    - The Kernel
    - The `udev` device manager
  - We can even read/write to these files to communicate with hardware.
  - There are two main types of files in `/dev`:
    - Character devices (`c`) - Data flows one character at a time (like keyboards, serial ports)
    - Block devices (`b`) - Data is transferred in blocks (like HDDs, SSDs, USBs)

- **`/etc`**
  - `/etc` contains system-wide configuration files and directories for the Linux operating system and installed software.
  - It contains configuration files for:
    - The system itself (hostname, users, networking)
    - Installed services and daemons (like SSH, Apache, cron)
    - Startup scripts and init system configs

- **`/home`**
  - `/home` is the directory where all regular users‚Äô personal data and settings are stored.
  - Each user has a subdirectory under `/home` ‚Äî this is their home directory.
  - Regular users own their home directories and can read/write inside.
  - Other users cannot access each other‚Äôs home dirs by default.
  - Admins (`root`) can access all of them.
  - On some systems (like servers), `/home` may be on a separate partition or disk to isolate user data.

- **`/lib`**
  - `/lib` contains shared libraries needed by the essential binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.
  - A library is a collection of code (functions, routines) that many programs can share, rather than duplicating that code inside each binary. These are like the "helper files" that programs rely on to run.
  - Types:
    - Shared libraries (`.so` ‚Üí shared object)
    - Static libraries (`.a` ‚Üí archive, less common in `/lib`)
  - What's typically inside `/lib`:
    - Low-level C standard libraries
    - Math, memory, and I/O functions
    - Dynamic linker/loader
    
- **`/lib64`**
  - `/lib64` contains `64-bit` shared libraries ‚Äî specifically, essential `64-bit` system libraries needed by `64-bit` binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.
  - On 64-bit Linux systems:
    - 64-bit binaries expect their shared libraries in /lib64
    - 32-bit binaries (if supported) expect them in /lib
  -  Without this separation, a 32-bit and 64-bit version of the same library would overwrite each other.

- **`/lost+found`**
  -`/lost+found` is a special directory created by the `ext4`, `ext3`, and `ext2` file systems to store "orphaned files", after filesystem corruption or unexpected shutdowns, if found during a disk check (`fsck`).
  - The file system repair tool (`fsck`) may find blocks of data that don‚Äôt belong to any known file or directory. Instead of discarding them, it stores them in `/lost+found`.
  - It is empty most of the time.
  - If not empty: files with numeric names like `#12345` ‚Äî these are recovered inode references, not real filenames.
  - You may need to manually inspect the contents (with `file`, `strings`, or `cat`) to understand what was recovered.
  
- **`/media`**
  - `/media` is the standard mount point for removable media (mostly plug-and-play devices), such as USB drives, CDs/DVDs, SD cards, external hard disks, etc.
  - Mount point is a directory where the connection with main filesystem tree happens.
  - Linux automatically mounts external devices when you plug them in.

- **`/mnt`**
  - `/mnt` is a standard directory used as a temporary mount point for manually mounting file systems ‚Äî such as internal partitions, ISO images, NFS shares, and other storage devices.
  - Unlike `/media`, it is not automatically managed.
  - It‚Äôs meant for system administrators or advanced users to mount devices or file systems manually.
    
- **`/opt`**
  - `/opt` stands for ‚Äúoptional‚Äù ‚Äî it is used to install third-party software packages that aren‚Äôt part of the default Linux distribution.
  - Think of it as a place for manually installed, large applications that live outside the package manager (like `apt`, `dnf`, or `pacman`).
  - You install software into `/opt` when:
    - It's a standalone app (like a full GUI application or a development tool)
    - You're not using the package manager (e.g., installing from a `.tar.gz` or `.run` file)
    - You want to keep it separate from system-managed packages
  - Each package usually lives in its own subdirectory under /opt.

- **`/proc`**
  - `/proc` is a virtual filesystem that provides a real-time interface to the Linux kernel.
  - It shows live information about your system, hardware, processes, and kernel internals ‚Äî all in the form of files and directories.
  - It‚Äôs mounted automatically at boot and doesn‚Äôt occupy real disk space.
  - Everything inside is generated on-the-fly by the kernel.
  - Exa: `cpuinfo`, `meminfo`, etc.

- **`/root`**
  - `/root` is the home directory of the `root` (superuser) account on a Linux system.
  - Why doesn‚Äôt home directory for root user live in `/home/root`?
    - `/home` might be on a separate partition, and that partition might not be mounted early during boot.
    - The root user must always have access to their home directory ‚Äî especially during rescue or maintenance mode.

- **`/run`**
  - `/run` is a temporary, RAM-based filesystem used to store system information and runtime data ‚Äî like PIDs, sockets, and lock files ‚Äî that are created and used while the system is running.
  - It is cleared on reboot
    
- **`/snap`**
  - `/snap` is the mount point for installed Snap packages. (When a software is installed via Snap, the actual application gets mounted inside `/snap`)
  
- **`/srv`**
  - `/srv` stands for "service" ‚Äî it is intended to store data served by the system‚Äôs network services, such as:
    - Web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
    - FTP servers
    - File sharing (e.g., NFS, Samba)
    - Other hosted content
  - It holds service-specific data (content of the program to be served), not the programs themselves.
  - Linux does not populate `/srv` by default. It‚Äôs up to the system admin or the application to place content there if following FHS standards.
    
- **`/sys`**
  - `/sys` is a virtual filesystem (called sysfs) that exposes information and control interfaces for the Linux kernel.
  - It provides a live view of hardware devices and kernel subsystems ‚Äî and sometimes allows you to modify them.
  - Purpose of `sys`:
    - Read hardware information (devices, buses, drivers)
    - Change kernel parameters (within limits)
    - Debug and monitor hardware status
    - Communicate with the kernel about system settings
      
- **`/tmp`**
  - `/tmp` is a directory for storing temporary files created by programs and users.
  - It‚Äôs meant for:
    - Short-lived data
    - Scratch space for apps
    - Files that don‚Äôt need to persist across reboots
  - It is writable by all users, but files are automatically deleted after some time ‚Äî usually on reboot or after a timeout set by the system.
    
- **`/usr`**
  - `/usr` stands for ‚ÄúUnix System Resources‚Äù ‚Äî despite sounding like it‚Äôs just for "user files", it's not for personal user data.
  - Instead, `/usr` contains read-only userland programs and data that are shared across the system.
  - It's basically a second root (`/`) ‚Äî for all non-essential, multi-user system files.
  - `/usr/bin` : contain non-essential user binaries (`gcc`, `python`, `git`, `node`, `curl`, etc.)
  - `/usr/sbin` : contain non-essential system binaries (`sshd`, `apachectl`, `dpkg-reconfigure`, `useradd`, `passwd`, etc.)
  - `/usr/lib` : contains shared libraries and internal binaries needed by the programs in `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`.
    
- **`/var`**
  - `/var` stands for "variable" and contains data that is expected to change over time ‚Äî such as logs, caches, mail, spool files, and even package manager metadata.
  - It is writable, unlike `/usr` or `/lib`, and is designed to store dynamic, growing data. 

<br>

### Why do we see `/bin -> /usr/bin`, `/sbin -> /usr/sbin`, `/lib -> /usr/lib`, `/lib64 -> /usr/lib64` on modern systems?

**Symbolic Link/ Symlink/ Soft Link:** A special file that acts as a shortcut or pointer to another file or directory.

In modern Linux systems (especially Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc.), there's a file system simplification effort to merge:
- `/bin` into `/usr/bin`
- `/sbin` into `/usr/sbin`
- `/lib` into `/usr/lib`
- `lib64` into `/usr/lib64`
But for backward compatibility, the `/bin`, `sbin`, `lib`, `lib64` names still exists (as symlink).

<br>

### What is `usr.is.merged`?
It is a marker file used by the system to indicate that this system uses the modern merged `/usr` filesystem layout.

## üõ°Ô∏è Working with permissions

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6a7a340-4815-4fea-8b2a-520e5634ba7d)

* File permissions in Linux control who can read, write, or execute files and directories. Permissions are assigned to three categories of users:

  - **Owner:** The user who owns the file.
  - **Group:** The group associated with the file.
  - **Others:** All other users on the system.
 
* How to read permissions?
  1. **File type:** The first character (`-`) indicates the file type
      - `-` : Regular file
      - `d` : Directory
      - `l` : Symbolic link
      - `c` : Character device
      - `b` : Block device
     
  2. **Permissions:** Next 9 characters, divided into groups of three. Each group specify the permissions for Owner, Group and Others respectively.
     
* Breakdown of each permission:
  - `r` (read): Permission to read the file or list directory contents.
  - `w` (write): Permission to modify the file or add/remove files in a directory.
  - `x` (execute): Permission to run the file as a program or enter a directory.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc4054ef-574d-4047-bc19-3c2922f3bdcb)

* Exa: `-rwxr-xr--` means:
  - **File type (-):** Regular file
  - **Owner (`rwx`):** The file owner can read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`).
  - **Group (`r-x`):** Members of the group can read (`r`) and execute (`x`), but not write.
  - **Others (`r--`):** All other users can only read (`r`).

### üìå `chmod` command
- Used to change file permissions. It allows you to modify who can read, write, or execute a file or directory.
-  1Ô∏è‚É£ **Using Symbolic mode**
  -  Syntax: `chmod [WHO][OPERATOR][PERMISSIONS] FILE`
  - **WHO**:
    - `u`: Owner (user)
    - `g`: Group
    - `o`: Others
    - `a`: All (owner, group, and others)
  - **OPERATOR:**
    - `+`: Add permission
    - `-`: Remove permission
    - `=`: Set exact permission

<br>

  | Examples            | Description                                                     |
  |-----------          |-------------                                                    |
  | `chmod u+x file.txt`| Add execute permission for the owner                            |
  | `chmod o-w file.txt`| Remove write permission for others                              |
  | `chmod a=rw file.txt`| Set read and write permissions for all                         |
  | `chmod --reference=source.txt target.txt` | Copy permissions from another file        |

<br>

  - Structure of octal permissions: Permissions are written as three digits, where each digit corresponds to a specific category:
    - First digit: Owner
    - Second digit: Group
    - Third digit: Others

  - Permissions are represented by three bits:
    - `r` (read) = 4
    - `w` (write) = 2
    - `x` (execute) = 1
      
  - The total value for a permission set is the **sum** of these numbers:

    | Permission | Value | Meaning            |
    |------------|-------|--------------------|
    | `---`      | 0     | No permissions     |
    | `--x`      | 1     | Execute only       |
    | `-w-`      | 2     | Write only         |
    | `-wx`      | 3     | Write and execute  |
    | `r--`      | 4     | Read only          |
    | `r-x`      | 5     | Read and execute   |
    | `rw-`      | 6     | Read and write     |
    | `rwx`      | 7     | Read, write, and execute |

    | Examples            | Description                                                     |
    |-----------          |-------------                                                    |
    | `chmod 744 file.txt`| Full permissions for the owner, and read-only for others        |
    | `chmod 666 file.txt`| Read and write permissions for everyone                         |
    | `chmod 751 file.txt`| Owner has full permissions, group has read/execute, others have execute only|
    | `chmod 750 file.txt`| No permissions for others                                       |

  <br>
 
  - **Examples:**
    
    | Octal   | Owner | Group | Others |
    |---------|-------|-------|--------|
    | `777`   | rwx   | rwx   | rwx    |
    | `755`   | rwx   | r-x   | r-x    |
    | `644`   | rw-   | r--   | r--    |
    | `700`   | rwx   | ---   | ---    |
    | `600`   | rw-   | ---   | ---    |

<br>

### üìå `chown` command
- Used to change the owner and/or group ownership of a file or directory. It is essential for managing file permissions and access.
- Syntax: `chown [OPTIONS] OWNER[:GROUP] FILE`
  - **OWNER:** The new owner (user) of the file/directory.
  - **GROUP:** The new group of the file/directory. Specifying :GROUP is optional.
  - **FILE:** The file or directory whose ownership is being changed.
    
    | Examples            | Description                                                     |
    |-----------          |-------------                                                    |
    | `chown user file.txt`| sets `user` as the owner of file.txt                           |
    | `chown username:groupname file.txt` | sets `username` as the owner and `groupname` as the group|
    | `chown :groupname file.txt`| change the group only                                    |
    | `chown -R username:groupname directory/`| change ownership for a directory and all its contents|
    | `chown --reference=source_file target_file`| set ownership to match another file      |

  <br>

### Default permissions
- When a file or directory is created in Linux, it is given default permissions based on:
  - The type of object (file or directory)
  - The user‚Äôs umask value

<br>

### What is `umask`?
- `umask` (short for user file creation mask) is a setting in Linux/Unix systems that controls the default permissions given to newly created files and directories.
- When a file or directory is created, Linux:
  - Starts with a default maximum permission
  - Files: `666` (`rw-rw-rw-`)
  - Directories: `777` (`rwxrwxrwx`)
- Subtracts the umask value from that default
- The result becomes the actual permission
  
  ```
  Final Permission = Default Permission - umask
  ```
  
  | Type      | Default | Umask | Final Permission  |
  |-----------|---------|-------|-------------------|
  | File      | 666     | 022   | 644 (rw-r--r--)   |
  | Directory | 777     | 022   | 755 (rwxr-xr-x)   |

<br>

- **Checking current `umask ` value**
  ```
  umask

- **Changing `umask` value**
  - Temporary (Current shell session):
    
    ```
    umask 027
    
  - Permanent: Edit your shell config file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.)
    
    ```
    echo "umask 027" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc

- **Common `umask` values and meanings:**
  
    | umask | File Permission | Dir Permission | Description                              |
    | ----- | --------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
    | 022   | 644             | 755            | Default on most systems (world-readable) |
    | 027   | 640             | 750            | More secure (no access for others)       |
    | 077   | 600             | 700            | Private (owner-only access)              |

  <br>

### Special permission bits
Linux provides three special permission bits in addition to the standard `rwx` (read, write, execute):

  | Special Bit | Use On           | Purpose                                             | Symbol                        | Numeric |
  | ----------  | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------- |
  | **SUID**    | Executable files | Run file as file **owner**                          | `rws` (`s` in user exec bit)  | `4`     |
  | **SGID**    | Files & dirs     | Run file as **group owner** OR inherit group in dir | `rws` (`s` in group exec bit) | `2`     |
  | **Sticky**  | Directories      | Restrict deletion to file **owners only**           | `t` (`t` in others' exec bit) | `1`     |

***Special permission bits are added in front of the usual 3-digit mode***

1. **SUID (Set User ID)**
  - When a **file with SUID** is executed, it runs as the **file‚Äôs owner**, not the user running it.
  - Used for programs that need elevated privileges temporarily.

2. **SGID (Set Group ID)**
   - On files: When a user runs a file with SGID, it runs with the file‚Äôs group privileges.
   - On directories: Files and directories created inside inherit the parent directory‚Äôs group, instead of the user‚Äôs default group.

3. **Sticky Bit**
   - The Sticky Bit is a special permission used only on directories, and it prevents users from deleting or renaming each other's files ‚Äî even if they have write access to the directory.

- Reading these in `ls -la`:
  
  | Output Example | Meaning                     |
  | -------------- | --------------------------- |
  | `-rwsr-xr-x`   | SUID set                    |
  | `-rwxr-sr-x`   | SGID set on file            |
  | `drwxr-sr-x`   | SGID set on directory       |
  | `drwxrwxrwt`   | Sticky bit set on directory |

> [!WARNING]  
> SUID can be dangerous if misused ‚Äî a buggy or malicious script with SUID could give root-level access. That's why:
> - Never set SUID on scripts (.sh, .py) ‚Äî only on binaries
> - Be cautious which programs have SUID set (e.g., find / -perm -4000 lists all)

<br>

### ACL (Access Control List)
- ACL (Access Control List) allows fine-grained control over who can access a file or directory ‚Äî more than just one user, one group, and others.
- With ACL, you can give multiple users and groups custom permissions on a single file or directory.

> [!WARNING]  
> ACLs provide powerful control, but can become complex and harder to audit. Use them when standard permissions are not enough ‚Äî and document your ACL changes well.

## üë®‚Äçüíª User Management

**User** - Entity that performs tasks and actions. Each user has an ID.

There are three types of users in Linux:

| User            | Description                   | ID                |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1. Root User    | Super admin                   | 0                 |
| 2. System Users | Ceated by OS to run processes | 1 - 999           |
| 3. Local Users  | Human users                   | > 999 upto 60,000 |

> [!NOTE]
> - For System Users (processes), if all IDs from 1 t0 999 are already in use, then IDs from local users are assigned to the processes
> - For Local Users, the upper limit of 60,000 is for Ubuntu. This number is kept for optimal performance and can be changed if required.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Why don't we use root user for everyday tasks?**
>   - We have multiple users working on a system, so giving root access to each user is not a good practice, as it would be very difficult to track user activities.
>   - Insted we create local users. These local users can have the root privileges using `sudo`.

### Switch user
| Commands       | Description                                     |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `su user_name` | Switch user (from `current_user` to `user_name`)|

## ü™Ñ Wildcards

<br>

Wildcards (also called globs) are special characters used by the shell (like Bash) to match patterns in filenames or strings. They're mainly used in filename expansion, searching, and command-line automation.

<br>

| Wildcard             | Meaning                                           | Example              | Matches                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `*`                  | Matches **zero or more characters**               | `ls *.txt`           | `a.txt`, `notes.txt`, `test.txt` |
| `?`                  | Matches **exactly one character**                 | `ls ?.txt`           | `a.txt`, `b.txt`                 |
| `[abc]`              | Matches **one character from the set**            | `ls file[12].txt`    | `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`         |
| `[a-z]`              | Matches **one character in a range**              | `ls file[a-c].txt`   | `filea.txt`, `fileb.txt`         |
| `[!abc]` or `[^abc]` | Matches **any char *not* in set**                 | `ls file[!3].txt`    | `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`         |
| `{a,b}`              | **Brace expansion** (not a wildcard, but similar) | `echo {Mon,Tue}.log` | `Mon.log`, `Tue.log`             |


<br>

**1. `*` (Asterik):** Matches zero or more characters in a filename or string.

<br>

  | Command             | Description                                                     |
  |-----------          |-------------                                                    |
  | `ls *`              | list all files in a directory                                   |
  | `ls *.txt`          | match files with a specific extension `.txt` (matches `file1.txt`, `notes.txt`, etc.|
  | `ls file*`          | match all files starting with `file` (Matches `file1`, `file2.txt`, `file_backup`, etc.)|
  | `cp *.jpg /backup/` | copy all `.jpg` files to a `backup` directory)                  |
  | `rm temp*`          | delete all files starting with `temp`                           |
  | `find . -name "*.sh"`| find all files ending with `.sh` in the current directory      |

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Escaping Wildcards:** To use a wildcard as a literal character (not as a pattern), escape it with a backslash (`\`).
>   - E.g.: `ls \*.txt` - search for a file named `*.txt`(literally)

<br>

**2. `?` (Question Mark):** Matches exactly one character in a filename or string.

<br>

  | Command             | Description                                                     |
  |-----------          |-------------                                                    |
  | `ls ????`           | match files with exactly four-character names (matches `file`, `test`, but not `files` or `fi`)|
  | `ls file?`          | match filenames like `file1`, `file2`, etc.                     |

<br>

**3. `[ ]` (Square Brackets):** Matches any one character within the brackets.

<br>

  | Command             | Description                                                     |
  |-----------          |-------------                                                    |
  | `ls [abc]*`         | match files starting with `a`, `b`, or `c` (matches `apple`, `banana`, `cat`, etc.)|
